Fun Story
----------
You are going about your day with your brother Kyle when a shiny demon appears out of nowhere. 

The demon asks you, "Be you angels?! If so, 
print me a list of all prime numbers from a range I will give you.
The range is inclusive with both the start and end points."

You wonder why you got into this predicament. Perhaps it's payback for
when you didn't do your prime number homework. 

You stand tall, and reply to the demon, 
"No, we are but programmers, rock!".

You realize you can write a program to do this task for you.
