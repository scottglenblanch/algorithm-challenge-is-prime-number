Fun Story
----------
You are going about your day with your brother Kyle when a shiny demon appears out of nowhere. 

The demon asks you, "Be you angels?! If so, 
print me a list of all prime numbers from a range I will give you.
That start number is always be 2 or greater. Then end number will be bigger than the star number.
The range is inclusive with both the start and end points."

You wonder why you got into this predicament. Perhaps it's payback for
when you didn't do your prime number homework. 

You stand tall, and reply to the demon, 
"No, we are but programmers, rock!".

You realize you can write a program to do this task for you. 

Specs
--------
Write a function that finds all prime numbers in a range. 
Start and end points are inclusive. 
Start and end points are greater than 2. 
The end point is always greater than the start point. 

Examples
--------
input: {startNum: 0, endNum: 10},
output: [2,3,5,7]

input: {startNum: 0, endNum: 100},
output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
